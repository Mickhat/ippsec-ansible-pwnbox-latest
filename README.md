# SETUP:

* Download the Hackthebox parrot version -> https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/iso/6.0/Parrot-htb-6.0_amd64.iso

* Install system to Virtualbox via any username

* open a terminal:
$sudo visudo
scroll down to the page and add this line bottom of the file

<your_username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

* open a new terminal and test it if sudo su works without a password.

* Run below commands:

`$sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`

`$git clone https://github.com/zer0dac/ippsec-ansible-pwnbox-latest.git`

`$cd ippsec-ansible-pwnbox-latest/parrot-build`

`$pip3 install ansible --break-system-packages`

`$ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

`$ansible-playbook main.yml`

* (in the burpsuite part, it will pop-up screen because its your first burpsuite opening, open burpsuite with default settings, I designed it that way because if some java version change, this ansible still will be usable)

* then open a new terminal > edit > profiles > Profile used when launching a new terminal video, also click on video and tick "Use the system fixed width font" if you don't want that big font.

* reboot your system, your system is ready to pwn HTB boxes on ippsec's environment.
